# ImagesToPDF
Use python to create a PDF given a folder with images.

This is a very simple project but very useful, just put your images in the /images folder and run the script, an output pdf will be generated.

It requires PIL and fpdf. Both can be installed with pip install, a requirements.txt is provided with the versions used.

This has been used for images of the same size (A4), if you plan on using images of different size you might need to change the script.
